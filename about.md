I used to run a Wordpress blog, then another Wordpress blog, and each sort of fell to the wayside.

One day I found the [Life](http://pyro2927.github.io/life/) repo and realized that maintaining content via a repository on GitHub was easy and enjoyable, and am working on migrating my blog posts and content to this project.
