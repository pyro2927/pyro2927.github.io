I think it&#8217;s something most people don&#8217;t take the time to do.  I know I certainly haven&#8217;t over the years.  When I was a kid I&#8217;d lay in the grass on a Saturday afternoon and just watch the clouds float by.  I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I really did that, though.  Life is rushing by, why can&#8217;t we just take the time to appreciate a single moment?

Today I decided I&#8217;d had enough of letting life pass.  It was time to just sit and appreciate the smallness of my life, and the expansiveness of the universe around me.  So I hopped in the back of my Chevy Colorado, and just looked up.<figure id="attachment_592" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-592" title="Clouds" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_0106-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful, aren&#8217;t they?</figcaption></figure> 

I stared at the clouds and was filled with nothing but insurmountable happiness.  My life will be short.  The earth has existing for millions of years and I&#8217;ll be lucky if I can break a century.  The molecules in the silicone chips running the server this blog is hosted on will break down before the sun burns out, but that&#8217;s OK.  I&#8217;m surrounded with people who love me, and whom I love in return.

Next time you&#8217;re outside, time the time to stop and just look up <img src="https://www.pintozzi.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
