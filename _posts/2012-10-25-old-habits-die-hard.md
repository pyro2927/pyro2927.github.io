With all of the [painting I&#8217;ve been doing recently][2], I&#8217;ve been reminded of the habits and things I&#8217;ve learned from past jobs.  Every summer after high school  I worked as a painter&#8217;s apprentice for my dad.  Some people thought it was easy for me to have a job working for my father, but they couldn&#8217;t have been further from the truth.  I was essentially the everyone&#8217;s bitch.  Since almost no one had seen me interact with my father, they didn&#8217;t know I was related to anyone else in the company, and I was treated the same as any new employee.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I wasn&#8217;t treated poorly, I was just giving the hard &#8220;new guy&#8221; tasks.  For that though, I am appreciative.  I have never worked a more physically demanding job, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be able to complain about the luxury of sitting at a desk job.  I learned plenty of useful skills during those summers though, how to paint, tape (mud), clean up work areas, and many other things I will never forget.

That was certainly not the only job I picked up habits from though.  Working as a bank teller really changed the way I viewed money, and even handled it.  Money in my wallet is always sorted from smallest to largest denomination, and all of the bills are facing the same direction.  From working at the [Centegra Hospital][3] I learned the proper amount of time to wash your hands is 14 seconds, which is the amount of time it takes to sign Happy Birthday twice.  Working at [The Dogg Haus][4] taught me plenty about dealing with drunk college students (most of whom were my friends), as well as how sometimes you need to do the work available, instead of waiting around for your &#8220;dream job&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve made many friends throughout the different places I&#8217;ve worked, and I&#8217;m happy to have had the opportunity to meet all of them.  While some of my former jobs may not be relatable to the skill set I show off on my resume, each one has shaped me into the man I am today and been a stepping stone on the path that is my life.
