This posting will probably end up having a timeline similar to that of [Momento][1]. Today Erin and I took Tucker to his very first puppy training class. While he wasn&#8217;t exactly the best trained, everything needs a first step. There was adorable Golden-doodle there, who I&#8217;m sure my mother would have loved.<figure id="attachment_645" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

On our way home, we stopped by Izzy&#8217;s Ice Cream. It&#8217;s a fun little shop that adds an &#8220;Izzy scoop&#8221; on top of a single or double scoop of ice cream, which is pretty much just a baby scoop. It&#8217;s a cute novelty, and gives the shop a unique feel to it. I grabbed an M&M scoop with Pumpkin on top. Delicious!<figure id="attachment_647" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Over the weekend we started painting our apartment. Not wanting to go with full colors in each room, we decided instead to do accent walls in the office, the bedroom, kitchen, and living room. I think the colors turned out nicely, though it turns out we picked the same colors that theme the Sherwin Williams store.<figure id="attachment_644" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I&#8217;m really happy how the few spots we&#8217;ve done (ok, mostly me) have turned out.  Erin does a great job at trim work and cleaning up, and I consider that a fair trade since I do the rest.

Last week I finished the final book in the Hunger Games series. They are definitely fantastic books, but I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the ending. It was very&#8230;.. different than what I was expecting. I&#8217;m happy to be getting back into reading books though, it&#8217;s a pleasure that I&#8217;ve forgone for too long. I have a few more books lined up on my Kindle, and we&#8217;ll see how long it takes for me to finish all of them.  Since I just watched [John Carter][13] today, I found myself wanting to read the books.  It turns out Amazon has all 7 books for just [99 cents][14]!  Score!  Looks like I&#8217;ll have bus reading material for the next few months.

There was a one and a half hour gap between that last paragraph and this one.  It turns out when migrating my WordPress installation the database got set to read-only mode.  Sadly I didn&#8217;t realize that and attempted every fix on the sun before discovering the error in my database permissions.

Anyways, back on track, I recently [ordered a shavette][15] in order to get into the world of single blade shaving.  It definitely provides a close shave, but in a few spots I got a little&#8230;. too close.<figure id="attachment_641" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-641" title="Ouch" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Photo-on-10-24-12-at-11.05-PM-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="388" />][16]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nicked myself with the shavette</figcaption></figure> 

Apparently I&#8217;ll need to work on my technique, but shaving is something I certainly don&#8217;t mind putting time into, as I find it to be a quite enjoyable way to start/end the day.

Now I need to start getting ready for the weekend.  Erin and I fly back to Chicago on Friday for her cousin&#8217;s wedding, but since that isn&#8217;t until Saturday I get to spend Friday night with Brad and Danny.  Looking forward to seeing them and riding in Brad&#8217;s new car!
