The human mind is a crazy thing. Recently I&#8217;ve been reflecting on all of the recent experiences I&#8217;ve been a part of. Camping with friends, buying a new car, driving on several 5+ hour road trips by myself. But even while I try to think about recent events, it pales in comparison to the 24 years I&#8217;ve lived on this earth. It&#8217;s the proverbial &#8220;drop in the bucket&#8221;. So last night I decided to just sit, and think about my past, think about where I&#8217;ve been and what I&#8217;ve done. I&#8217;m sure a day will come where even most of these memories will fade, so hopefully documenting them will preserve them ad infinitum (or at least until my hard drive and all my backups fail). So posted below are a handful of memories from my past.

**The Pot**

The earliest memory that I can recall is shitting in a ceramic flower pot. I don&#8217;t even fully remember the house that our family lived in at the time, but I remember playing outside in the back yard and really having to poop. &#8220;Oh hey! This thing kinda looks like a toilet!&#8221; So I sat down, did my business, pulled up my pants, and kept playing around. I definitely remember Mom and Dad not being too happy, but I was young and stupid.

**Montini**

Oh where to begin. Montini is full of tons of memories, from hot lunch days (don&#8217;t forget your lunch money!) to playing on the blacktop. I remember Patrick Truleson always being the troublemaker and breaking a tower I built once. Eric Net and Ryan Kranz ran around &#8220;monkey bumping&#8221; the other kids so that they would fall down (they would knee you in the upper thigh to induce a [charley horse][1]). I remember hating the uniforms, and Lucas Adams smashing a mustard packet with his fist, causing it to spray all over several students. Another Ryan Kranz moment was ding-dong-ditching the convent on the school grounds. Not typically something you would want to do, upset a group of nuns at a Catholic school, but he found it necessary. I remember liking all of my teachers, and even finding Mrs. Schotz to be really pretty. Of course you would, 8th grade me.

**The Chair**

Another strong memory I have from growing up was Omi&#8217;s house. For those not acclimated with the German language, &#8220;Oma&#8221; is the word for grandma. Apparently young Joe butchered the word and it became &#8220;Omi&#8221;. To this day I still love visiting Omi, but I&#8217;m not longer small enough to partake in one of my favorite activities: napping underneath her chair. It&#8217;s an oddly shaped chair, somewhat like a horse shoe with a platform in the middle. This created a little alcove that I was just small enough to fit in while curled up into a ball. It was such a comfortable place, and I&#8217;m not sure if it was the sense of security, the warmth, or just the general coziness that attracted me to it. I hope that when I have children someday, they have small nooks that they can claim as their own.

**Girls**

Can a young man ever forget about girls? Probably not, but we can go through the long list of girls I had crushes on growing up. My earliest &#8220;crush&#8221; (if you could even call it that) was on Heather Gebhardt. I don&#8217;t know why really, she was just the nicest and prettiest girl I had ever met, which I guess when you&#8217;re only 10 years old is about the only criteria you can rate girls on. I wasn&#8217;t exactly the most suave, or even outgoing for a grade school kid, and her friendship towards me was probably mostly sympathetic since I was a bit of a nerd, but all I can hope is that she&#8217;s still as nice to people today as she was to me over 14 years ago.

**Tyler Foley**

Next up though, first kiss! &#8220;WTF?&#8221;, you may be wondering. I thought the title said &#8220;Tyler Foley&#8221; (as you go back and re-read it). It does, but that&#8217;s because Tyler Foley is one of the most influential people in my life. As I mentioned previously, I wasn&#8217;t exactly a ladies man in my younger years (nor am I even now), but in high school I had a small group of amazing friends. One of those friends was Tyler, who has sadly since passed. I think about our friendship often, and got a tattoo to be constantly reminded of what an amazing person he was.<figure id="attachment_441" style="width: 448px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

That picture was taken only a few minutes after my tattooing session was done, so it&#8217;s layered with Vaseline and just bleeding a bit. Back to our story though, during our sophomore year at Marian Catholic High School, Tyler was dating Kim Pacton. Kim was friends with Sarah Kavouras, and the four of us ended up at a Marian basketball game. We were away at another school, and while I don&#8217;t remember which one, I remember eating two hotdogs that day. During some down time in the game, Tyler asked Sarah, &#8220;You and Kyle broke up, right?&#8221; &#8220;Yea&#8221;, she replied. &#8220;Cool&#8221;, he said, &#8220;Well now you&#8217;re dating Joe.&#8221; While probably not verbatim, that&#8217;s essentially how the conversation went. I&#8217;m sure I blushed, I know I felt awkward. Pretty girls didn&#8217;t date weird hot-dog-inhaling geeks like me. Or so I thought. But that was that, and Sarah and I ended up dating for a short while. As I had never kissed a girl before in my life, I was absolutely terrified about what to do. &#8220;What if I mess it up?!?!?! What if I do it at the wrong time?!?! I&#8217;ll be shamed for life!&#8221; I guess I got lucky, as Sarah got tired of waiting around for me to kiss her, and while at Kim&#8217;s house on a double date with Tyler and Kim, in the middle of Finding Nemo, she kissed me. It was no peck, I was definitely thrown into the deep end of the kissing pool, but I survived and didn&#8217;t make a fool of myself.

While Sarah and I only dated for 2 or 3 months, Tyler continued to influence my life in countless other ways. He invited me over for Halo LAN parties, which to this day are still some of the fondest memories in my life. I was able to be a geek, and still be social. He taught me how to play paintball in his back yard, and introduced me to a good percentage of the music I listen to today. [Coheed and Cambria][3] was a big one, and was one of the first bands I listened to where I realized that multiple songs could be strung together to form a story. There was also a heavy dosage of [Linkin Park][4]. Both bands I still listen to on a fairly regular basis, and while my tastes have more recently shifted to heavy metal, I will have a deep appreciation for the artists that created the music Tyler and I would just sit and listen to for hours.

**The New**

The saying is &#8220;out with the old, in with the new&#8221;, but in the case of memories, why not maintain both? This past weekend I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of hosting my younger sister Olivia, as well as my two best friends from high school at my new apartment. We had a blast, and while I was sad to see Brad and Danny leave last night, I had an awesome time with them and experienced many great things about Minneapolis. Every meal was eaten at a new restaurant, cafe, or diner. We visited several bars, and played a few rounds of billiards. Four days from now I&#8217;ll actually be down in Chicago, visiting them again and celebrating Brad&#8217;s birthday.

While I have many good memories past, I will continue to look forward, enjoy life, cherish those around me, and live to the fullest.
