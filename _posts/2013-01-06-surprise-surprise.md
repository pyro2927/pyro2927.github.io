Today marks my 25th year alive on this planet.  I&#8217;ve successfully not died for a quarter of a century.  Normally I wouldn&#8217;t think much of it, but with my grandfather passing away at 76 years old, it puts the perception in my mind that a third of my life is over.

While that comes across as quite a negative statement, I couldn&#8217;t be more happy with my life so far.  I have amazing family and friends, a fantastic job, and have been on plenty of adventures.  That said, I hope none of that stops and continues on for the rest of my life.  Up until now the only thing I&#8217;ve never had is a surprise birthday party.  They&#8217;ve always seemed like fun, and I&#8217;ve been jealous of everyone who gets thrown one.<figure id="attachment_755" style="width: 358px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

This weekend that all changed.  As I got off work on Friday, I realized I had no plans for my birthday.  I made arrangements to get together with a few friends at the [Muddy Pig][1].  Everything was fine and dandy until I got home and Erin said she was slightly upset with me.  She said it with a smirk, and I was slightly confused.  She then informed me that she had planned a surprise birthday party for me, inviting several of my friends, at the same place and time that I had started making plans for.  While I was slightly upset with myself for ruining my own birthday plans, it was cool that Erin knew what I liked well enough to plan the same thing that I did.

The plans were made for Saturday night, and Friday night we had a quiet night with a little home made parmesan chicken.  Saturday morning Erin made some homemade salsa to go with fresh corn chips.<figure id="attachment_756" style="width: 2448px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

After giving it a thorough taste-testing, I helped our neighbor/friend Matt pick up a new couch.  When we got back, Erin coerced me out of the apartment for a long enough time, and then texted me saying she needed help with a large package that was delivered.  I walked downstairs and was greeted by the smiling faces of my best friends from Chicago, Brad, Dan, Catherine, and Carly.  That part of my birthday remained a total surprise, and it&#8217;s more than I could have asked for.<figure id="attachment_757" style="width: 3264px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

We spent the night drinking, sharing stories, eating good food, laughing and smiling.  It was my first (un)surprise birthday party and it was perfect.  Today was spent recovering and relaxing, and feels like the perfect end to an awesome weekend.  I couldn&#8217;t have asked for anything more, and I owe the great time to Erin and my wonderful friends. <img src="https://www.pintozzi.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
