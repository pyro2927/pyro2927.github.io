Humans are fallibile.  Programmers are human.  Programmers write automated systems.  So, automated systems are fallibile, and that proved itself this past month when I terminated my two year contract with AT&T.  I left them for Verizon, who provides better coverage and speed where I live, and I knew I would have to pay an early termination fee.

Doing my research in advance, I discovered that their fee was $325 minus $10 per month of your contract that you had completed.  Previously I was on a family plan with my mom and sisters, and one of them had used my &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to get a replacement iPhone 4S back in December.  At the end of May I migrated my contract off of the family plan and created a new individual account for myself.  A few weeks later I got my final bill for AT&T, but it said my termination fee was $295!!  Far more than three months had passed since December 2011, but apparently they recognized my account as being only &#8220;created&#8221; at the end of May, so when I cancelled my account in September only three full months had passed.  Needless to say I was a little disappointed.

While on my lunch break today I made a quick phone call to AT&T&#8217;s customer support line.  I explained my situation, and verified my existing account info, as well as the information of the account I previously belonged to.  After being on hold for about 60 seconds I was told, &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry Mr. Pintozzi, your final bill has been adjusted and you now only owe $245.&#8221;  Just like that I was able to save $50!

I&#8217;ve run into this a few times, if you ever feel like you&#8217;re being charged too much, just ask.  Worst case scenario you waste a few minutes, but it can really save you a good amount of money!
