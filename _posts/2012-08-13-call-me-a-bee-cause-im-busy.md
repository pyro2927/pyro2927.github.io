And that&#8217;s pretty much the long and the short of it.  When I was little I never understood why adults were always so busy, and now I realize it&#8217;s because there is so much going on in life.  On Friday last week there was a bank robbery downtown, so when Paul and I went to get lunch there were a few city blocks that were completely off limits.<figure id="attachment_528" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Work last week went smoothly, but there seemed to be a bit of a rush on Friday as a big project was going to be coming up that would require some snappy turn-around.  Time for &#8220;download meeting&#8221;!<figure id="attachment_529" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It was something that really reaffirmed my decision to come up to Minneapolis and work for GoKart.  They seem to follow the saying &#8220;Work hard, play hard&#8221;, something my father has always told me my entire life.  While a meeting starting at 5:15pm isn&#8217;t exactly what everyone desires on a Friday, ingesting some delicious beer while doing so definitely made  it a comfortable way to work.

Friday evening we hung out with Val again (who you can learn about in [this post][3]), and made our way to <Brasa> and the [Acme Comedy Company][4] to watch some standup comedy.  Dinner at Brasa was delicious, and turned out to be a good suggestion by Josh (yet another coworker) as it was a decent selection of American food, of which Val really wanted to experience more.<figure id="attachment_530" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Ok, well the guacamole isn&#8217;t exactly American, but it was delicious.  After that we swung by the comedy club and watched a few amateurs, a good feature, and then the headliner, Pete Lee.  I quickly realized that a lot of jokes revolve around double meanings, innuendos, and other &#8220;tricks&#8221; in the English language.  The good news is that Val seemed to have a good grasp of the language and understand most of them, and when he didn&#8217;t I would lean over and do my best to explain the joke.<figure id="attachment_531" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

On Erin and I attended the [2nd Annual Twin Cities Beer Fest][8].  For $17 each, we got all-you-can-drink access to over three hundred micro-brews.  It was a total blast, and we definitely got our $17 worth.  I lost count of how many beers I had sampled after a while, and I just couldn&#8217;t hold the hammer straight while playing hammerschlagen.<figure id="attachment_533" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

We were home by 10:30pm and crashed.  When you start drinking at 3pm, you get tired so much sooner.  Overall we&#8217;ve been making a ton of new friends, and I&#8217;m happy with how projects at work are ramping up.  In my small amount of spare time I actually worked on competing in a programming competition at [CloudSpokes][12], and I&#8217;d love to write about my experience, but until the judging occurs mum&#8217;s the word.
