Yet another iDevice has been unleashed upon us.  This time it&#8217;s the iPad Mini.  A few people joke that it&#8217;s just a large iPod, but that&#8217;s hardly true, atleast from a development standpoint.  While it has no retina display, the 7.9&#8243; screen packs the same number of pixels as the iPad 2 (1024&#215;768).<figure id="attachment_659" style="width: 828px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

What does this mean for developers?  Pretty much nothing.  UISplitViewControllers are still used for Master/Detail style views, and there won&#8217;t be any changes to the SDK.  One thing designers will definitely have to keep in mind though, is that everything is smaller.  Yes that button you designed will remain 90 x 44 pixels, but with a smaller screen that target will be physically smaller for your end user.  If your users had a hard time with small controls before, get ready for them to fail miserably when those controls are an additional 21% smaller!

It&#8217;s an interesting move by Apple.  [Steve Jobs seemed to scoff at the idea of a 7&#8243; tablet][2], but with the recent success of sub-10&#8243; tablets being manufactured by other companies Apple may not have a choice.  I think it will be interesting to see the Mini play out.  It&#8217;s been a while since Apple has had a product flop (think [Newton][3]), and with the iPad&#8217;s overall success I doubt it will do poorly.

I look forward to working on some slightly smaller iPad experiences to add to the [GoKart Labs portfolio][4]!
