If I&#8217;ve learned anything from moving in with Erin, it&#8217;s that communication is key.  It is especially important when it comes to dealings with money, as we don&#8217;t have joint accounts but we do split the cost of bills and food.  As we have vastly different interests, our &#8220;play money&#8221; is spent in vastly different ways.  Something that&#8217;s helped immensely in understanding each other is coming up with our own definitions of a few already defined words.  One of those such words (well I guess technically two words) is: &#8220;shower curtain&#8221;.

The one thing that was hardest to wrap our heads around was the fluff, the extra stuff, the unnecessary.  Even before we moved in together, when out shopping we would occasionally ask each other, &#8220;why are you buying that?&#8221;.  Answers of, &#8220;because I like it&#8221; were always greeted with a &#8220;but why?&#8221;  Never able to formulate an answer that made much sense, I finally settled on, &#8220;You know how you have that second shower curtain on the outside of the shower?  It does&#8217;t actually do anything, all of the water is held back by the white plain one on the inside, but you like the look of the fancier one on the outside, so even though it&#8217;s technically unnecessary, you bought it.&#8221;  And with that it all seemed to make sense.  &#8220;Why are you putting new brake lights on your motorcycle?&#8221;  Shower curtain.  &#8220;Why did you pay more Anniversary package on your car?&#8221;  Shower curtain.  With those two little words I was able to convey my thoughts more clearly than had I used twenty.<figure id="attachment_675" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

There are other -isms and words we use, though none are quite as efficient as &#8220;shower curtain&#8221;.
