I&#8217;m still getting settled in here in Minneapolis, and at the same time getting ready for my first guests.  Jim and Karl will be up visiting before Matt&#8217;s wedding, and Erin flies in on Friday.  To make sure that everyone is properly welcomed, I went out and bought a grill to put on the balcony.<figure id="attachment_393" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The weather has been a little crazy lately.  My usual routine for getting to work now has been to take the bus to work, and then walk home.  The bus gets me to the office in about 15 minutes, compared to the 25 minute walk it would take me, and walking home is a nice way to unwind and enjoy the city.

After work today I checked out a local grocery store, Kowalski&#8217;s.  They had a bunch of great food, and reminded me of a nicer version of Metro Market from back in Milwaukee.  The absolute best part though, is that they are open 24/7!  Never again will I crave that frozen pizza and be unable to satisfy my appetite!  Upon returning home from Kowalski&#8217;s, I decided to tidy up some more and finish assembling my desktop.  What good is it if it&#8217;s not put together?<figure id="attachment_394" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

That is actually where I am typing out this blog post from.  So just imagine me sitting there, typing away, and it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re practically here!<figure id="attachment_395" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing many friends this upcoming weekend at the wedding.  It should be fun, and I know lifetime memories will be made.
