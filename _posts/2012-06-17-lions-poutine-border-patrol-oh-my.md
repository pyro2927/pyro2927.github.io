Words cannot describe the amount of fun I had this past weekend. I flew out of MSP on Thursday evening to Lansing, MI, where Erin picked me up and brought me to Detroit for Tom Pabst&#8217;s (my cousin) wedding. While it was in a hot greenhouse, I had an absolute blast and wouldn&#8217;t have changed a single thing about the evening. Dancing, talking, and mingling with my family is something I will always cherish.

The flight out wasn&#8217;t without troubles though. To start, the flight was delayed by an hour to start. After that, poor weather conditions and debris on the runway caused us to sit on the runway for over an hour, just waiting for our turn to take off. Instead of landing at 10:10pm, I landed at 12:30am. Thankfully Erin was patient enough and waited for me in Lansing.

The wedding was awesome, and while I may not remember 100% of the evening due to alcohol consumption, there were many highlights. I hope all EMTs now realize they need to bow down to Jeff Campbell, as in his words, &#8220;This is what I do.&#8221;

After the wedding on Sunday, Erin and I headed over the Canada for lunch. Heading there was no problem, and we had a nice meal at Harvey&#8217;s and walked along the lake in a park. Coming back, on the other hand, was a whole different story. We were questioned by border patrol about the vehicle we were driving, why we were not driving a car either of us legally owned (it was Erin&#8217;s dad&#8217;s Impala), and why us Midwesterners were in Canada. The US guards were rude and would not explain why we were being searched. They forced us to get out of the car and sit in a waiting room while they searched the vehicle, and then finally told us we could continue on our way with no reason.

So here I sit, in the O&#8217;Hare airport, waiting for my flight home. Delayed, again. Being Father&#8217;s Day, I&#8217;m reminded of everything my dad has done for me. He has shaped me into the man I am today, and I can only hope to be the kind of father he is some day. He has taught me patience, the importance of respect, how to be wise but not a smart-ass, and everything I&#8217;ve ever needed to know. I can only hope he understands how much I love him, and while I may live over 7 hours away now, I think about him and my mom all the time.
