I was the target of some bank account phishing over the weekend, and I must state that I am quite impressed.  It started with an innocent enough text message.<figure id="attachment_74" style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-74" title="Phishing" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Photo-Jun-05-5-51-24-PM.png" alt="" width="640" height="960" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Vague enough....</figcaption></figure> 

I hadn&#8217;t made a purchase for $121.01 that day, so of course I sent back a 2.  The interesting thing to note is that before I even had a chance to respond to the text, I received 3 calls from that 800-355-5265, and after I was told I would receive a call they stopped.  Interested in where this would go, I checked my voicemail and called the number.  In the voicemail, an automated message had given me a &#8220;reference number&#8221; that I had to enter upon calling back.  At no point during my call did I talk to a human, it was a completely automated system.  After a few &#8220;Press 1 if&#8221;s, it asked to confirm my identity.

&#8220;Please answer the following questions so we may confirm your identity.  Question 1: During June of 2010, what company did you get an auto loan through?&#8221;  Whoa whoa whoa, this is exactly the kind of stuff that I get asked when running a credit report, or applying for a credit card online!  I didn&#8217;t answer, and instead hung up.  A quick [Googling of that number][2] reveals that [it is indeed a scam][3], I&#8217;m just impressed with how well executed it is.  I could definitely see someone who is not so versed in automated telephone systems, or used to dealing with fraud departments with Chase (sadly, I&#8217;ve had to talk to them on several occasions), could easily be fooled into turning over innocent-seeming information about themselves.

For all those non-techs reading this, just remember to always stay on your guard.  If you ever stumble upon a situation that seems &#8220;phishy&#8221;, don&#8217;t hesitate to talk to someone you trust first who can give you a second opinion.  Also, play it safe.  When requested to call your bank, call the number on the back of your credit card instead of the one included in a text or email.  That way you can be absolutely sure you are talking to the right people.
