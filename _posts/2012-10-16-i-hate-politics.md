I just had to get off Facebook.  I truly can&#8217;t take any more of the incessant bitching and complaining about the damn debate.

Tomorrow at work we are having &#8220;Crocktoberfest&#8221;, which I&#8217;ve taken to calling &#8220;Rock out with your Crock out&#8221;.  It might not be the most politically correct phrase, but meh.  Half of my goods for the event will be brownies, and I&#8217;m backing them Butch Pintozzi style.  That&#8217;s right, DOUBLE BATTER!  In about 5 minutes they should be done and I can start frosting them, because REAL brownies have frosting.  After that I&#8217;m gonna have to check out Dishonored (PC videogame), because I picked it up off GreenManGaming, but I haven&#8217;t had much time to play yet.
