As I sit waking for the 50S Eastbound bus, I can&#8217;t help but feel happy. Even though I just barely missed he last one and am guaranteed at least a 15 minute wait, it&#8217;s Friday and the weekend is here so I don&#8217;t care.

Well shit, just missed the next one because I wasn&#8217;t paying attention. Oh well.
