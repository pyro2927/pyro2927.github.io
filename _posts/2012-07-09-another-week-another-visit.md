This past weekend was a blast, and the upcoming one will be even better.  On Saturday Erin had a going-away party at the Ale House, followed up by a stop at Victor&#8217;s.  Many people attended, many beers we drank, and bottles of champagne were won at Victor&#8217;s Saturday night dance contest!  It was great seeing everyone, and I look forward to going back to visit and do it again sometime.

The end of the week is gonna be BIG.  Erin drives in Thursday afternoon, and Olivia flies into MSP on Thursday evening.  Then Brad and Danny drive in Friday around 5pm, so after I get off work I&#8217;ll have 4 guests staying over for the weekend!  There will definitely be grilling, a stop at the Mall of America, and hopefully many miscellaneous adventures!

And for something totally random, Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) is the hottest vampire I know of.
