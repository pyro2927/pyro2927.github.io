Yesterday around 4pm a power transformer outside of my apartment building blew up. With how many things are electronic in my apartment, it was pretty easy to realize right away. The lights were actually off to begin with since it was still light out, but the thermostat , TV, computer monitors, and server all turned off in an instant.

Luck was on my side though, as earlier in the day I had gone with Luke to Costco and bought a 6 pack of battery-powered LED lights for underneath the kitchen cabinets. For dinner Erin and I had to go out, as the stove is electric. Olive Garden made a tasty choice, and following that Josh and Jes were kind enough to invite us over for some heat and a round of [Ticket To Ride][1]. It turned out to be an awesome game and we all had a great time.

Today Erin and I visited the Science Museum of Minnesota. The Body Worlds exhibit was there, and I had never seen it before. It was a ton of fun, and I&#8217;m always reminded of how awesome science is each time I visit a museum like that. Hoping to be extra nerdy, we signed up to be members at the museum. Not only did that give us discounts on our tickets, but it also allows us to be a party of the [ASTC Passport Program][2]. With that we gain free entry to over 290 museums around the world!! I&#8217;m pretty pumped about that, and I hope to stop at a lot more museums over the next twelve months.

We were asked to not take pictures of the Body Worlds exhibit, and aiming to be respectful of that I was unable to get pictures of them. I&#8217;d highly recommend it to anyone though, as it was extremely interesting and a great learning experience!
