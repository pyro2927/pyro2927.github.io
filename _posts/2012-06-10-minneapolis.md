I&#8217;ve moved into my new apartment that I will be subletting until the end of August. At that time I will have the choice to sign a year long lease, or find a new place.  It&#8217;s all been a rush, from receiving the job offer from GoKart Labs, to finding a place to live in between trips to Texas, Haiti, and Canada.  I have my wonderful sister Mary to thank for getting me the information of the place I&#8217;m at now.  It worked out quite well that her friend&#8217;s brother was moving out and needed someone to take over the lease.  It also worked out that he was willing to leave some furniture, giving me time to bring my things up here instead of doing it all at once.  Knowing that, I only brought up my computer and clothes, plus a few essentials like shower towels and deodorant.  As of this very moment I&#8217;m setting in with some Chinese delivery (thanks to Szechuan Spice) and an episode of MythBusters.<figure id="attachment_353" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It&#8217;s a bit exhilarating, as a lot of this is new to me.  I&#8217;m new to Minneapolis, having only been here for less than 24 hours total in my life.  Moving in the day before starting a new job is a bit intimidating, but I&#8217;m excited for the challenge.  I&#8217;ve also never lived completely alone, always having roommates for the past 24 years of my life.  The feeling of &#8220;leaving home&#8221; really set in on the drive out here, and was a bitter-sweet moment that I&#8217;m sure will be with me for a while.

I brought a few minor things to remind me of the people in my life.  Last year for Christmas, Erin gave me a picture frame with a picture that was taken when we went Christmas tree hunting.  It resides on my computer desk and always causes me to smile.  She also bought me a candle from Yankee Candle as an apartment-warming gift.  It burns brightly, and the smell of Orange Dreamsicle is wafting through the bathroom.<figure id="attachment_354" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It hasn&#8217;t even been a full day, but I know I will miss being close to my family.  I won&#8217;t be able to drive five minutes down the road to surprise Omi, or five minutes the other direction to visit my cousin Oliver.  I know I&#8217;ll have a greater appreciation for family time when I have it, as it will be far less common and not nearly as often as I&#8217;d like.  I will even miss seeing my sisters as frequently as before.  While growing up I probably never thought I&#8217;d say this, they are two of my best friends and I can&#8217;t imagine a life without them.  I&#8217;m lucky to have the parents I have.  They have been nothing but supportive my whole life, and I can only hope that when I have children some day, I am able to be as good to them as my parents were to me.<figure id="attachment_355" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
