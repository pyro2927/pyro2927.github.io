Yesterday was the kind of day that makes you lean back and say &#8220;Yea&#8230;. great day&#8221;.  It started off with Erin and I visiting the Lyric @ Carleton Place to sign and finalize our lease for September.  While it will result in a small increase in rent, it&#8217;s definitely going to be worth it and I&#8217;m looking forward to having much more space AND a dedicated office.  After that we swung by Bonnie&#8217;s Cafe to have brunch.  It was extremely tasty and I definitely wouldn&#8217;t mind becoming a regular there.  Bonnie&#8217;s is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place that only accepts cash.  There is a small wait staff, but I think that is part of what creates its appeal.<figure id="attachment_501" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Upon filling our bellies we headed back to our current apartment to clean.  It had gotten a little messy during the week, but two hours of teamwork cleaning got it back into shape quickly.  Groceries were stocked with a trip to Kowalski&#8217;s, a quaint 24-hour grocery store on Hennepin Ave.  At 5pm I left to pick up Valentin and bring him over for dinner.

But who is Valentin, you may ask?  Last week GoKart Labs gave it&#8217;s employees the opportunity to work alongside Habitat for Humanity for the day.  While on site I met several great people, willing to donate their time while asking for nothing in return, and one of those individuals was Valentin.  He explained to us that he was a French student who came to America for the sole purpose of learning English, and the host family he was staying with told him that if he didn&#8217;t plan on doing anything he would end up being quite bored sitting in their house all day, every day.  I must say that I find it extremely admirable for someone to donate their time helping people in a country outside of their own.  He could have opted to sit in a bar each day, and drink away his time here, but instead he found people in need and offered his help.

Picking up Val almost felt like a first date.  There was the awkward drive to the house, a house I had never seen before and only had the address.  When I arrived the host mom and a few other people were outside.  &#8220;Uhh.. 3558?&#8221;, I sheepishly asked as I stepped out of the car.  &#8220;Yea! You must be here for Valentin&#8221;, host-mom replied.  &#8220;He&#8217;s just inside. VAL!!!!&#8221;  He quickly ran out, greeted me, and we turned to head off.  Though, I wasn&#8217;t sure about his stay here, rules that had to be followed, things like that, so I kindly asked the family, &#8220;So&#8230; does he need to be home by a certain time or anything?&#8221;  I realize he&#8217;s a full grown adult, but I tend to honor the requests of the head of the household when possible.  She kindly said he could come back whenever he pleased.

Back at our apartment, I started grilling hamburgers while Val chatted with both Erin and I. We learned he has a pilot&#8217;s license (only for gliders and small planes), has a girlfriend back home and is excited to see her, and many other fun facts.  My initial attempt and making grilling the hamburgers on the stove-top skillet/grill was a failure, and Erin had to make sure I knew how funny it was that I could simultaneously burn the outside while keeping the inside completely raw.  She kindly took over and grilled many good burgers, as well as three brats that we picked up from the deli.  Lettuce, tomato, avocado, and cheese were all prepared as toppings, though I passed on the cheese.  Unless it&#8217;s a Sobelman&#8217;s, no cheese for me.<figure id="attachment_504" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

After dinner the three of us discussed music, Erin made a round of Gin & Tonics, and we talked about some of our favorite movies.  One of my coworkers, Kevin, invited us over to his place for a bonfire.  Another drive through this new city and we arrived, meeting a bunch of new people who were all extremely friendly.  I was quite happy, as several of them were developers, so we were able to &#8220;nerd it up&#8221; and talk about technology, videogames, etc, all while having a few and sitting around a nice fire.<figure id="attachment_510" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Before I knew it, it was 1am!  Not wanting to stay out too late and be exhausted the next day, we headed home.  Today Erin and I are planning on visiting the [MN Food Truck Fair][4], and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get to see Valentin again before he flies back to France in two weeks.
