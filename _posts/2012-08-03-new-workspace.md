I currently work for GoKart Labs in Minneapolis, MN.  When I flew up for an interview, I met the current GoKart employees in their office, which is an awesome industrial styled space. Between then and my start date, something bad happened: the GoKart space flooded.  When I started working for GoKart they were in a temporary office hosted inside of Capella Tower, and while it was definitely a fun place, I am happy to have moved back to the original GoKart space today with the other employees.<figure id="attachment_497" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

GoKart released a blog post that I was even quoted in!  You can read it [here][2].  We had to pack up the old space earlier in the morning, and then after a slightly extended lunch break/pub crawl we unpacked everything at the old/new space!

By the time I finished unpacking and setting up my workspace, it was time to go home.  While I didn&#8217;t have a change to really crank out some good work with the new setup, I&#8217;m excited to start fresh Monday morning!
