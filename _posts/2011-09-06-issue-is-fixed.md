So I feel bad not posting in a while. Work has had me really bogged down. A promotion is a nice thing, but it brings on so much more work!

I&#8217;ve gotten the Hawk running decently again by replacing the fuel line. It seems there were a few kinks in it. Now I just need to tune the carbs and it&#8217;ll be perfect!!!

Just in time for winter&#8230;.
