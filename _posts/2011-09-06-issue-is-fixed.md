So I feel bad not posting in a while. Work has had me really bogged down. A promotion is a nice thing, but it brings on so much more work!

I've gotten the Hawk running decently again by replacing the fuel line. It seems there were a few kinks in it. Now I just need to tune the carbs and it'll be perfect!!!

Just in time for winter...
