After I graduated college I quickly realized that many of my friends were moving away, and that social opportunities were quickly diminishing as I entered the business world.  As the Summer of 2010 began, I promised myself that I would take advantage of as many opportunities each Summer, and never pass up on anything fun.  That was the first Summer I made it out to Canada for a motorcycle rally, and have made it out to every one since.

I still maintain that promise to myself, and have been doing many things this year.  Fun activities this Summer have been:

  * Southern Ontario Wrench Day (aka Canada Hawk meetup)
  * Tom & Abby&#8217;s wedding
  * Matt & Deanna&#8217;s wedding
  * Camping/lazy-river with Erin and friends
  * Trespass America Tour in Milwaukee with Oliver
  * Having Olivia, Brad, and Dan come up to Minneapolis to visit
  * Flying back to Chicago to celebrate Brad&#8217;s birthday
  * DefCon 2012

Today Erin and I went to the MN Food Truck Festival.  We picked up VIP tickets off LivingSocial which allowed us to have unlimited micro-brew samples, which we definitely took advantage of.<figure id="attachment_515" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

While we saved a good amount of money on our tickets for the event, I still wouldn&#8217;t consider it fully worth it, and will probably not care to go back next year.  There were about eight food trucks, and the line for each was about half an hour long, if not longer.  The line just to get our wrist bands took half an hour as well.  That said, I had a great time and I&#8217;m glad I had the experience.

Next weekend will be host to another Minneapolis event, the Twin Cities Beer Fest.  Public transportation makes drinking wonderfully easy, since I never need to worry about driving anywhere.  It&#8217;s gonna be a blast and I&#8217;m looking forward to another great weekend!
