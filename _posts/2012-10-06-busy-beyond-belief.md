Things have been busy, but also extremely exciting in the Twin Cities.  Saint Paul is a great place, and for my anniversary with Erin we went to [Heartland Restaurant & Farm Direct Market][1].  I think my favorite part of the meal was when I started picking up the bottle of wine to pour Erin another glass, and a waiter promptly walked over and said &#8220;let me get that for you, sir&#8221;.  With a smile on his face he refilled both our glasses.  While it wasn&#8217;t anything absolutely extraordinary, it was one of those little things that really completes a dining experience.

Two weeks ago (whooaaaa, jumping back in time!) we had a great camping adventure with some good friends from Marquette.  Erin and I usually end up cooking breakfast while camping with friends, and this most recent time was no exception.  Bacon, eggs, eggs-in-a-basket/sunshine-toast, pancakes, we made it all!<figure id="attachment_585" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

While we didn&#8217;t do as much extreme climbing as last year, it was definitely just as enjoyable.  Lacking a tent, I grabbed [this one][3] off Amazon.  I originally thought, &#8220;there is NO way that can hold 8 people&#8221;, but I was wrong, it most certainly can.  Unrolling it out I kept muttering, &#8220;when will it end?!?!?!&#8221;  Eventually it did and it was monstrous!  Two full days of campfires and adventures followed.<figure id="attachment_586" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Today we went to a pet adoption event and picked up a puppy!!  He&#8217;s two months old and we&#8217;ve named him Tucker.<figure id="attachment_587" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

He&#8217;s a little ball of energy, and the best part is that he seems potty trained!  He sat at the door today and whimpered, and after we let him out onto our patio he went straight for a vine/bush and pooped in it!  It&#8217;s maybe not a &#8220;pretty&#8221; thing to talk about, but it&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;m appreciative of!

**WARNING**:Most of what follows is tech, so you might just want to skip over it.

I&#8217;ve been racking my head against against DDWRT almost the whole day.  I&#8217;ve been wanting to get a simple wireless client-bridge up and running, as I don&#8217;t have my box of CAT5e cable with me up here (it&#8217;s on its way).  I have a [TP-Link MR-3020][6] and a [WRT54GL][7], which have OpenWRT and DDWRT respectively.  On each one I tried setting up a bridged network via command line and the web GUI, but neither one seemed to be able to connecting to my existing WPA2 secured network.  After 4 hours of getting frustrated at it not working, I went to the Apple store in Uptown and grabbed an [Airport Express][8], drove home, and have it configured and working 5 minutes after I got back.<figure id="attachment_588" style="width: 810px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

With that setup I now have wired access in both bedrooms in the apartment without running cables all over the place.  Additional good news is that with the ESXi update to version 5.1 the motherboard in my tower has a supported LAN chipset (RTL8111E), so I threw in a spare 500GB hard drive and have been messing around with it for fun.  I&#8217;d like to build a new desktop and transition this machine into a ESXi server full time, but I&#8217;d rather not stretch funds too thing and wait a few more weeks.

All in all, life is grand and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.
