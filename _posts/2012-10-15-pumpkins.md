Another week has gone by and it&#8217;s been a blast! I had the chance to grab a drink with Miles earlier in the week (a former GoKart employee) and this weekend Erin and I made our way out to Stillwater for their annual [Harvest Fest][1]! Erin&#8217;s friend from Marquette (and mine since), Matt, was able to join us and we trekked out in the mild rain.<figure id="attachment_603" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Stillwater is a fantastic little down, and is the kind of place I hope to be able to have a family when I reach that point in my life. We saw giant pumpkins, though my favorite attraction was the chili cook-off! For $10 you get to try 12 different chilis, and at the end you vote for while you think tastes best. Chili #2 was made by a Chicago transplant and his friend, so while their chili wasn&#8217;t the absolute best, it was definitely in the top two for me and I voted for them because of their Blackhawk pride!<figure id="attachment_606" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Sunday was very relaxing. I wiped Matt&#8217;s Macbook Pro clean so he could sell it, and drove it back to his house on the NorthWest side of Minneapolis. There aren&#8217;t many snow-free days left, so any chance I get to drive the Camaro around is one I won&#8217;t turn down. We also made kabobs when he was over on Friday night. We used the gas grill on the roof and they turned out perfectly!<figure id="attachment_609" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Tucker is doing well. He&#8217;s starting to use the bathroom outside more, as I think we made the mistake of training him TOO well to use his potty matt when inside overnight. Oh well, he&#8217;s still only 9 weeks old so I can&#8217;t expect much from him. I look forward to our drive home on Thanksgiving, not sure how that will turn out, but hopefully it&#8217;s not too bad. We&#8217;ll be driving with one of Erin&#8217;s family friends, Pat. He&#8217;s a nice kid and I&#8217;ve met him before, and he attends the U of M up here. I get to drive through the campus every day on the buss on the way to work, and it&#8217;s exciting seeing the student attire change as the temperature drops. There are still a few crazies who wear t-shirts and shorts, but I doubt it will remain that way for long.<figure id="attachment_608" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Tonight for dinner Erin made some tomato soup from scratch and it was DELICIOUS! Blended tomatoes, vegetable stock, onions, and other stuff I don&#8217;t even know. It was amazing and was topped with two grilled cheeses. I think my favorite part about living together is the fact that I get amazing food all the time!<figure id="attachment_607" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Finally I ordered a new Macbook Pro Retina yesterday. It&#8217;s weird, because even though I&#8217;m insanely excited for it now, I know some day I&#8217;ll be an old man with kids and a house, and will laugh at the measly excitement I get from purchasing some piece of technology. Or maybe I&#8217;ll still be the same boy who got excited over his N64 when <del>his parents</del> Santa got it for him on Christmas. Either way, it&#8217;ll be sweet when it arrives, and I plan on having a whole weekend of re-doing my home network!
