Every night I follow the routine. Final check on email. Cuddle with Tucker. Take him for a walk, make sure he pees. Warm up his rice pack, wrap it in one of my old tshirts, and try to coax him into his cage. Brush teeth. Use the bathroom. Sleep.

My days follow a routine, too. At least Monday through Friday. I used to fear being stuck behind a desk from 9-5, probably because of the way media portrays the typical desk job. I&#8217;m extremely happy to be working at GoKart Labs. My coworkers are awesome, the environment is relaxed yet professional, and I get to work on a variety of amazing projects. Where some may see boring repetition, I see a schedule which I am extremely comfortable with. I feel like this is something that was never really covered in college, how a job can be &#8220;fun&#8221;. And maybe that&#8217;s because most people don&#8217;t have the opportunity to have a fun job. I do my best to be appreciative, and can only hope that other people find the same sort of enjoyment in their lives.

I guess it&#8217;s time to go. After all, I have a routine to stick to.
