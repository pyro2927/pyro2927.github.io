For the third year in a row, I made my annual journey to Ontario Canada to visit friends and fellow Honda Hawk enthusiasts.  The first year I was armed with little more than my motorcycle, a backpack, and a tank bag.<figure id="attachment_77" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-77" title="SOWD 2010" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0017-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My valiant steed back in 2010</figcaption></figure> 

Year two I was accompanied by another forum member, Andy (k-os).  We drove out with my Chevy Colorado and a enclosed trailer with both of our bikes.  This year it was just me again, but with my pickup and the Hawk in back.<figure id="attachment_78" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Departing at 7pm worked out quite well, as by the time I hit the highways in Chicago there was absolutely no traffic.  The drive was uneventful, as it should be.  8 hours later and I had made my way into Brantford, fell onto a bed (thanks to the generosity of Brent),  and slept for 6 hours.  Waking up and walking outside I saw this:<figure id="attachment_79" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The day was spent wrenching and talking, talking and wrenching.  While that may sound boring to some, there is no other way I would have rather spent the day.

While some bikes were merely fixed, others were upgraded.  Rich&#8217;s bike got some sweet work done to it that I&#8217;m sure will give it a lot more Force.<figure id="attachment_80" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

As we \*cough\* Brent really, I was useless \*cough\* went to put on my replacement chain, it was discovered that the splines on my output shaft were worn down WAY too far, and needed to be replaced.  Replacing the output shaft means taking apart the whole engine, so out she dropped.<figure id="attachment_81" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

After the disassembly we all took a nice ride down Lover&#8217;s Lane.  For the U.S. readers, it was not the adult&#8217;s-only store, but instead an awesome road to ride down.  Brent was extremely generous and let me ride his VFR, which I&#8217;ve now falling in love with and want one of my own.

On Monday night, there was some final last-minute work done to my subframe.  I didn&#8217;t exactly have any mounting points for most of the under tail components, but a short visit from the doctor, and some bike surgery, fixed that right up.<figure id="attachment_86" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The only sad part about wrench day is when it has to come to an end.  Every time I have more fun than I event anticipated, and this year was no exception.  It was great meeting Tony and Rich, and I only wish I could have stayed longer.  Hopefully after I accrue some decent vacation time from my new job I can take a full week off to visit!<figure id="attachment_87" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
