With two days to go until the annual Southern Ontario Wrench Day, I&#8217;ve started packing up my belongings.  Since I won&#8217;t have a copilot during the ride there and back (read: someone else to take turns driving with) I&#8217;ve decided to rig up a good electronic buddy.<figure id="attachment_52" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Loaded up with music and TomTom navigation for USA & Canada, she&#8217;s all ready to be my sidekick in the SOWD adventure.  I also stopped by the store to pick up some goods for the journey and for use upon arrival.<figure id="attachment_53" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Gatorade, several microbrews, cases of RedBull, beef jerky, trail mix, and water.  Will pack up the rest tomorrow evening and head out!
