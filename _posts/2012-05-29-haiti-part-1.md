I start this as a part one because I know I will not be able to contain the last 8 days of my life into one post.  My trip to Haiti was exhilarating, heartbreaking, and most definitely an experience I will remember for the rest of my life.

My family and I, as well as Father Sherry and my Aunt Renee, flew out to Haiti via Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Monday, May 21st.  It was a tiring morning, as we left the house around 4am, but we were happy on the inside.<figure id="attachment_14" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption alignright">

The women were all professionals, as they had made the trip before.  I, on the other hand, had no clue on what to expect once we arrived.  I had seen poverty in China, back when I visited there in 2006, but it did not compete with the poverty of Haiti.  We stayed with the Missionaries of Charity, a group of nuns who have patience and compassion that I have yet to see matched by another human being.  They take care of orphaned, sick, and dying children on a daily basis, something that wore me out after one week.  I cannot begin to imagine all the things they have seen in the years they have been doing their work.<figure id="attachment_16" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption alignright">

For a while I didn&#8217;t realize the gravity of the situation.  The first day I was there I thought, &#8220;Holding kids is nice, but what can I build to help?  When does the construction/restoration/painting start?  Where is all the manly work?&#8221;  It was then that I was fortunate enough to meet a terrorizing youngster named Augustine.  She was a bit of a playground bully, but nice as far as kids go, and always had a huge smile on.  We were playing, and I was giving her piggy-back rides around the playground, when my mom came up to me with a somber look on her face and stated, &#8220;She has AIDS.&#8221;  It wasn&#8217;t meant to damper the mood, rather to educate, and it worked.  I realized that each of those children are there for a reason, and that holding them, playing with them, and letting them feel loved and cared about was more important than any door hinge I could fix, wall I could paint, or window I could install.  Were it not for the Missionaries of Charity, these kids would most likely die within a few days, alone and forgotten.<figure id="attachment_17" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Holding those children and playing games with them is the most rewarding thing I have done with my life, and while I want to go back to help restore homes and feed the hungry, I will always make sure to take the time to hold a child, and let them feel loved.
