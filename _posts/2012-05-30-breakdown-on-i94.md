I would have liked to post Haiti &#8211; Part 2 this morning, but instead I had a nice motorcycle breakdown on I94 yesterday evening while on my way to visit Erin.  At mile marker 322 I suddenly felt something slap against my leg.  Hard.  I didn&#8217;t need to look down to know that the whack on my leg, combined with my sudden loss in acceleration, meant that my chain had broken and my rear wheel was now powerless.<figure id="attachment_29" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Thankfully past-Joe thought it was a great idea to include roadside assistance on his motorcycle insurance, and a quick 5 minute call had the tow company on their way gratis. Also thankfully, I was wearing my riding boots, and I can now say that while they are expensive, they were/are well worth the purchase in protecting my feet.<figure id="attachment_30" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

My chain guard is a little chewed up, but it remains functional and I should have a new 520 O-ring chain ordered by this weekend, just in time for the Southern Ontario Wrench Day!

As an added bonus to this post, here are two pictures of the /r/motorcycles stickers I received in the mail.
