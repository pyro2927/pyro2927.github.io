It&#8217;s that time of year again, time for me to fly out to Las Vegas and enjoy DefCon 2012.  As of writing this I&#8217;m already on my last full day out here.  I arrived on Wednesday night at about 10:30pm, and it has been a non-stop party ever since.  But really, what else do you expect from Vegas?<figure id="attachment_473" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Brad and Dan are my two partners in crime when it comes to hacker-cons (no pun intended).  We&#8217;ve been to DefCon, ThotCon, SchmooCon, and DerbyCon.  We&#8217;ve made various friends during it all, and have learned many important things relating to computer security.  One of the best parts of the conferences we go to are the number of parties that are sponsored by corporations in the field.  Spiderlabs, Rapid 7, and Exploit Hub, are just a few companies that have thrown awesome parties, each with an open bar.  I have to be reminded of a common [FOSS][2]saying: &#8220;Free as in speech. Free as in beer.&#8221;<figure id="attachment_474" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The only thing I have negative to say about DefCon this year, is that it&#8217;s grown so big, it&#8217;s at times impossible to make it into a talk.  There are a total of five tracks, and any time a &#8220;cool&#8221; talk is presented, you have to get into the room about three talks ahead of time and sit there until the really good talk starts.  So far I&#8217;ve only made it to four talks, and I&#8217;m not sure how many I&#8217;ll make it to today since I&#8217;m supposed to be competing in Hack Fortress today.  For the uninformed, Hack Fortress is a game where five individuals play [Team Fortress 2][4] while three other teammates try to hack into certain things to earn points.  When the hacking side completes a goal/task, their corresponding teammates on the TF2 side get powerups/bufs in the videogame.  At the end of it all points are tallied and a winner is announced.  Last year we lost by one point in the semi-final round, so hopefully we can pull it together this year.<figure id="attachment_475" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Tomorrow is the flight home.  It leaves at 8:30am, so I&#8217;ll be waking up bright and early just to make it to the airport.  Brad and I actually are on the same flight into Chicago, and then I transfer on to Minneapolis, so it&#8217;ll be nice to spend that last bit of time together.  Dan had to leave early this morning to make it back in time for his sister-in-law&#8217;s wedding (technically he&#8217;s not married, but close enough).  I&#8217;ll be passing on DerbyCon when August rolls around, as I have a wedding to attend myself, so I&#8217;ll be making sure to enjoy my last day here.
