Another weekend in Minnesota has turned out to be another weekend of fun!  Thursday night was fun, as Jim, Karl, Cristina and I had a cookout on my balcony.  It had to be on a charcoal grill as propane ones are not allowed.  While enjoying fine dining on brats and burgers, we watched [Beerfest][1] and [Goon][2].

On Friday Erin and I took a nice tour of the [Lyric][3] on Friday during my lunch break, and then after work we just walked around Uptown/Downtown to simply get a feel for the area.  It was a lot of fun, and it turned out to also be [Pride Weekend][4]!  It really makes me happy to be living in such a progressive and open minded city.  There was a ton of music and liveliness as we walked around, and I look forward to doing it again and again.

Saturday was Matt & Deanna&#8217;s wedding.  The ceremony was in a nice church, and it was fantastic to spend time with college friends.  I quite enjoyed the cardboard cutout of Scott (who is currently in seminary school), and if I find a picture of it I will be sure to share.  We partied late into the night, and getting the hotel was a good idea as I was in no condition whatsoever to drive.

Sunday was recoup day, and it was well spent.  Erin and I toured another apartment complex, and then hung at at the [Mall of America][5]!  It was definitely huge, and there were a lot of fun stores to check out.<figure id="attachment_401" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Besides the theme park there were HUGE LEGO structures!<figure id="attachment_403" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

We ate at Buffalo Wild Wings, a nice reminder of being back in Milwaukee as Erin and I both loved to go to the one on Water Street.  The Mall of America&#8217;s closeness to the MSP Airport allowed us to stay there until shortly before Erin&#8217;s flight home.  After dropping her off I just continued on transitioning my life up to Minneapolis.  Minor things, like calling Progressive and switching my insurance policy up here.  It was more of a pain than I had hoped, as moving to a new state requires a completely new insurance policy to be written and the old one to be cancelled.  The good part is that I&#8217;m one more step to being a true Minnesotan, though as I utter those words I am unsure as to how I feel about it&#8230;
