When I initially heard of FreedomPop I simply passed it by.  It seemed to good to be true.  &#8220;Free 4G Internet!!&#8221;  Yea, right.  I&#8217;ve gotten emails by the truckload offering me the same thing.  They sent me a few reminders each week, most recently offering to include a extra free 1GB if I signed up.  I finally decided to bite the bullet, as I was sick and tired of dealing with locked down airport WiFi when traveling.

During initial signup you can choose between a few different 4G devices.  A USB stick, a &#8220;puck&#8221; that allows multiple devices to connect, or an iPod touch case.  Each has a different deposit requirement, and I went with the USB as it was the cheapest.  It came in at $50, plus tax, plus ~$10 shipping.  They also automatically enroll you into a &#8220;to-up&#8221; program, where you get an extra 100MB added to your account for a few bucks once you get within 100MB of your monthly allotment.  I turned that feature off, and then was informed that by turning auto top-up I&#8217;m actually limited to 400MB a month, instead of the advertised 500, because the system won&#8217;t let me within 100MB of my allotment without top-up.<figure id="attachment_799" style="width: 2448px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Despite those annoyances, it seems to work just as easily as they say.  I hooked it up and ran a speedtest inside my apartment.<figure id="attachment_801" style="width: 1084px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I haven&#8217;t been able to give it a great testing yet, and I&#8217;m going to be saving that sweet 400MB for when I&#8217;m outside my apartment, but I&#8217;ll be reporting further findings as I go.
