I recently learned that the Computer Programming class I took at Marian Central Catholic High School is no longer being offered.  I decided to write a letter to the superintendent (Mr. Landers), in hopes that something can be done to get this class brought back for the students.  The text of the email has been pasted below

My name is Joe Pintozzi, and I graduated from Marian Central Catholic High School in 2006.  I currently work for a booming company in Minneapolis, MN called [GoKart Labs][1].  I develop iPhone and Android applications, and my job is something I have fallen completely in love with.  I simply cannot imagine doing anything else for a living, and it&#8217;s all thanks to a Computer Programming class I had my sophomore year at Marian, taught by Mr. Liggett.

The reason for this email is the fact that during my visit last month to Marian, I learned that the class that has been the largest influence in my career, and indirectly my life, is no longer being taught.  Many things happened during that class, many things that I will truly never forget.  First, I met my two best friends.  As we all know, there are many clicks and groups in high school, and it is not always easy to fit in, or find those with similar interests.  The jocks have their sports, the theater kids have their plays and performances, and the computer kids had their programming classes.  Or at least they used to.  Brad Collins and Dan Borkowski were two guys I was fortunate enough to meet during my time in the Computer Programming class, and to this day remain two of the most important people in my life.  We spend time together on a regular basis, and have helped each other in times of need more often than I can count.  Without the Computer Programming class, I may have never met them.

More importantly than that, though, is the other life changing moment that occurred in that classroom.  All of the computers at Marian have all chat programs disabled/blocked, so that students do not waste time chatting with other individuals and remain focused on their work.  Being an insistent geek (and I use that term with affection), I decided that I would write my own chat program in Java, the programming language I was being taught by Mr. Liggett.  Surmounting such an obstacle required me to learn many things that were beyond the scope of the classroom, and I ended up teaching myself quite a bit of programming just to be able to chat with the guy sitting two seats down from me.  It was quite fun, and I ended up sharing my newly built program with a few other individuals in the class room.  Eventually it made it&#8217;s way to Bill, and being a typical tattle-tale, he instantly raised his hand and told Mr. Liggett that I was using a chat program that was supposed to be banned on school computers.

As Mr. Liggett got up from his desk and walked over to where I was seating, I felt terrified.  I knew I had done something that the school would consider wrong, and was afraid of what sort of punishment I would receive.  His only question to me was, &#8220;How did you get this on the computer?&#8221;  I then explained that I had not gone and installed an existing program, but rather that I had just written an extremely basic chat program on my own.  The next words spoken to me are ones I will never forget, and have continued to drive me, nay, accelerate me, into the career I have today.

&#8220;Well… if you made it, you can use it.&#8221;

With that he walked back to his desk and class carried on.  Bill sat there upset that I had not gotten in trouble, and I sat pondering what had just been said to me.  As a pre-Computer Engineer, I felt completely empowered to take on the world of programming.  I had found a world in which I could create something from nothing, create things for myself or friends, and I was only limited by my own imagination.

I continued my education at Marquette University, taking courses in Computer Engineering.  During my junior year at MU, I had wished I had an iPhone app to surf my favorite website in between classes, [reddit][2].  Such an app did not exist, but the words from years before echoed in my head.  &#8220;If you made it, you can use it.&#8221;  I went out and downloaded &#8220;The iPhone Developer&#8217;s Cookbook&#8221; by Erica Sadun.  After a few weeks of hard work and self-teaching, I released my application and quickly gained popularity on a [few sites][3].  I was on Cloud 9, and once again had the feeling of being able accomplish anything.  I started doing contract work for smaller companies in the Milwaukee area, and ended up with a full time job offer before I even graduated from Marquette.

I sit here writing this today, and I ask you to please consider bringing back the Computer Programming class at Marian Central.  It is not just a simple class, it is a place for geeks and nerds (myself included) to find other like minded individuals and make life-long friendships.  It is a place for curiosity to be satisfied, and self-teaching to be encouraged.  Without the Computer Programming class I highly doubt I would be doing what I do today, as it was my first experience with programming.  Without the words of Mr. Liggett ringing through my head, even six years later, I would have not felt empowered to do all of the things I have done.
