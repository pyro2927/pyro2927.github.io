Uncreative title, I know.  As some of you know, I prefer shaving with a double edge safety razor.<figure id="attachment_479" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-479" title="Merkur" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Merkur_heavy_duty_safety_razor-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="387" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Exactly like this one</figcaption></figure> 

There are many reasons, but the top two are the fact that it&#8217;s incredibly cheap (only about 5 cents per shave), and that it makes shaving a much more enjoyable experience.  The only downside is that over time I accumulate a decent amount of not-so-dull razor blades.  Disposing of them can be troublesome, because if you casually throw them into a garbage bag, they can easily cut a hole through the side, causing other debris to fall out.  I saw a picture online of a guy who had painted a piggy-bank and turned it into a blade-bank.  I sent him a message, asking him how much it would take for me to get one.  A few days later I received one in the mail!<figure id="attachment_480" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The holder of blades!</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_481" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img class="size-large wp-image-481" title="Piggy" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_0569-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="435" />][3]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">He sits next to my bathroom sink</figcaption></figure> 

So far he holds a single blade, but I&#8217;m sure over time he will amass many.

In other news, Erin made dinner last night and it was delicious!  AND it was vegetarian!  Really that was only because we forgot to buy chicken at the store, but the salad was amazing and I&#8217;m looking forward to leftovers.<figure id="attachment_482" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-482" title="Salad Dinner" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_0573-764x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="782" />][4]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Can you guess which drink was mine?</figcaption></figure> 

Honestly I&#8217;m not even sure if the lettuce was a special kind, but the salad included roasted sunflower seeds, chopped up chunks of tomato, strawberry, and mozzarella cheese.  I ate a whopping two bowl-fulls because it was so good!

After that we tried to whip up some cake balls.  Who am I kidding, Erin did almost all of the work, I just sat and watched.<figure id="attachment_483" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

They are definitely going to be a mixed variety.  We were able to put white chocolate around several of them, but then it started become mushy, and the balls started falling apart, so the rest will be covered in actual cake frosting, which I think will still taste quite delicious.  Tonight we&#8217;ll be going out for sushi with Paul and his fiancé Lindsey!  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a fun time, and I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to it.
