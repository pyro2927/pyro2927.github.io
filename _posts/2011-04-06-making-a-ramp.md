Not a direct update on my Hawk, but I created a ramp to use with my pickup for easier loading/unloading of the bike.  I purchased [this ramp kit from Amazon][1].  It seems to have come out well, though I won&#8217;t have a chance to test it until this Saturday, Carb Day #2 with K-os![<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-110" title="Photo Apr 06, 9 18 49 PM" src="http://bluegt88.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/photo-apr-06-9-18-49-pm.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="365" />][2]
