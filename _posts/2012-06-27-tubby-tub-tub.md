&#8220;Tubby tub tub&#8221; is one of the few things my friends from high school and I say instead of the word &#8220;fat&#8221;.  While I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily consider myself to be a fat individual, I have most definitely gained weight since I graduated college, and I haven&#8217;t been doing much to attempt to stay in shape.  I&#8217;ve tried several times to get into the habit of working out, but each time it slips away and I once again become comfortable with sitting on the couch eating carbs.  Today I started up another workout cycle, hoping that this one sticks.  Dan B. told me about [Endomondo][1], and we linked up to be friends.  Hopefully he can remind me how lazy I&#8217;m being when I don&#8217;t work out, which should be great motivation to get off my ass and get running.

I only worked out a little bit today, as I haven&#8217;t done so in a while.  Running one mile took the wind out of me, and biking on a stationary afterwards for a mile was a decent cool down.  The &#8220;fitness room&#8221; here at Eat Street Flats isn&#8217;t the biggest.  One weight machine, one treadmill, and one stationary bike.  I guess I shouldn&#8217;t complain since it&#8217;s free, but I&#8217;m looking forward to a nicer workout room once I switch apartments.

On a completely different topic, I unlocked the boot loader on an [HTC Vivid][2] today.  One of the positives about the Android platform has always been it&#8217;s &#8220;open-ness&#8221;.  It&#8217;s sad to see a good number of hardware manufacturers locking their boot loaders.  I did not realize until today that while HTC locks their boot loaders prior to shipping hardware, they have a [website dedicated to allowing end users to unlock the boot loaders on their purchased devices][3].  HTC has definitely gained my respect with this move.  It&#8217;s great to know that the cat-and-mouse game played by Apple and iPhone users is not replicated with HTC.
