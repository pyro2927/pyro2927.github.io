A while ago I [posted how I emailed my old high school][1], requesting that they reinstate the Computer Programming class that I went through as a sophomore.  I received the following response from Tom Landers, the Superintendent at Marian:

Hi Joe

It was good to hear from you especially recounting the positive experience the computer programming class and Mr. Liggett&#8217;s influence has had in your life.  Regarding the programming class, this past year was the first year that the class was dropped from the curriculum.  It was done for two reasons &#8212; a) enrollment had diminished to six students the last year it was offered; and b) we added a new class for math/science students &#8212; survey of engineering.  Please know that I am very aware of how programming fits into today&#8217;s technological world.  We are in the process of determining where and how to potentially reinsert programming into existing courses here at Marian so that students, like yourself, can continue to be introduced to this &#8220;language&#8221; in the future.

Best wishes to you.

While it makes sense that low attendance would normally be a sign to drop a class, when I was enrolled in Computer Programming there were also only six students in the class. I also understand trying to exchange a niche class for something that has a broader coverage of engineering, but I worry that getting rid of the more specialized class will cause small sparks of interest to never flourish into roaring flames of programming passion.
