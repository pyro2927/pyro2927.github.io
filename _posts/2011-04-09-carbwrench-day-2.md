Today was a day full of fun.  I met Eddie, and spent plenty of time working on my Hawk.  And just like the first time, Andy (K-os) was a huge help.  It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m running on 5 hours of sleep, and I&#8217;ve been up since 7 am, so I won&#8217;t be writing too much.  The day Started with a stop at Harbor Freight to pick up a 1,000 lb limit motorcycle lift, that itself weighed 360 lbs.  Threw that in the back of my pickup and headed north!  The day was spent wrenching, cleaning, attaching, and fixing.  I now have a speed-bleeder on my front brake, and my Mikuni pump has replaced my stock fuel pump.  One less electrical component to worry about <img src="https://www.pintozzi.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Finally got it running again today.  Sounds as good as ever
