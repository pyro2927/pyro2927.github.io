It&#8217;s been three full days since I&#8217;ve been back in America, and every day I&#8217;m reminded how fortunate I am.  From the little, to the big, everything in some way makes me remember how lucky I am to live in this country.  For instance, take our simple living arrangements.<figure id="attachment_35" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-35" title="Haiti Entryway" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0158-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Our "front door"</figcaption></figure> 

While I am both extremely grateful and thankful for the living arrangements provider to us by the Missionaries of Charity, I am equally if not more thankful for the home I have in McHenry.  In Haiti, the doors were always locked in order to keep us safe and off the streets.  The large steel doors made it feel somewhat prison-y, but they are used due to the fact that wood doors easily warp when not properly maintained, and steel offers better security against those trying to break in.

The weather never went below 88°F, and we considered ourselves lucky when a slight breeze rolled through our living quarters.<figure id="attachment_37" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class=" wp-image-37" title="Hot" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0165-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][3]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hot. Every day.</figcaption></figure> 

By day 2 I was riddled with bug bites and used to avoiding water unless it came in a bottle.  For me, that was the hardest thing to get used to.  I&#8217;m one of those &#8220;weirdos&#8221; (read: engineer who likes efficiency) who brushes his teeth in the shower.  In a country where you can&#8217;t be sure of the water&#8217;s cleanliness, that is a big NO-NO.  No opening your mouth in the shower, no brushing your teeth with water from the sink.  Even the jugs that the water came in needed to be cleaned and rinsed with bleach water before we could open them.

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38" title="Cleaning Water Jugs" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0170-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][4]

Eventually all of these things became habit, but the first thing I did upon my return home was take a shower with my mouth wide open.  It&#8217;s just so refreshing.  And if you&#8217;ve never tried, you should.

Cooking was also an interesting experience.  Since we couldn&#8217;t leave the &#8220;fortress&#8221;, we couldn&#8217;t visit the grocery store.  We did have someone who helped us, a very nice man named Vilar, who could pick up a few things for us if necessary, but that was usually more along the lines of paper platers, napkins, etc.  Our frozen chicken and Bubba Burgers were smuggled in via backpacks with ice packs inside of them.  Cooking in front of a propane stove in 90° weather is not something I would put on top of my &#8220;Favorite things to do in Haiti&#8221; list, but it was definitely an experience.<figure id="attachment_39" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

No TV, and often no electricity, forced us to keep our minds off the heat and find ways to entertain ourselves.  Sadly I forgot my book at home, and became what Olivia and Mary would consider to be an annoying pest as I found ways to entertain myself.  One such way was to watch the lizards crawl around the ceiling and sometimes attack each other.  Of course everyone watched, and often a little bit of quiet reading time would be interrupted by a finger pointed upwards.  &#8220;LOOK!&#8221;<figure id="attachment_40" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-40" title="Lizards" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0187-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][6]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My name is Inigo Montoya...</figcaption></figure> 

The girls did NOT like when the lizard-battles were occurring directly above them, but I found it to be pretty exciting.  There was a large plus side to no TV/electronics, it was great for everyone to open up and share stories.  I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve laughed as much as I did on that trip.  We make jokes, shared childhood memories, poked fun at one another, and had a fantastic time getting to know each other.  I can also now say without a doubt in my mind that Mary&#8217;s boyfriend, Eddie, is a great guy and is a perfect match for her.  Though I mostly think that because he gives her crap and causes her as much grief as I do.<figure id="attachment_42" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-42" title="Mary and Eddie" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0201-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][7]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Just look at those faces</figcaption></figure> 

We helped the Sisters in any way that would could, whether it be holding children, feeding the babies, watching youngsters during mass, tiring out the energetic ones before bed, or other miscellaneous things like cutting pills in half.  A whole pill has a dosage that is too high for the babies who need them, so we spent hours cutting pills in half, which would then be administered to the children.<figure id="attachment_43" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I&#8217;m happy to be back.  I&#8217;m catching up on all my TV shows that I missed, and reading more of my books.  One thing is for certain though; every now and again I&#8217;d like to turn off the TV, turn off the cell phones, sit around with my friends and family, share our stories, and enjoy the happiness that we bring to each other&#8217;s lives.
