I graduated highschool weighing around 165 lbs.  By the time I graduated college I was up to 178.  On January 1st, 2014, I came in at 192.

As of yesterday, I&#8217;m down to 172.

In the past I&#8217;ve tried various ways to lose weight.  I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s most motivated person, and I hate working out.  It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s painful, it&#8217;s just so incredibly boring.  &#8220;I&#8217;m just gonna go run for an hour&#8230;. on a machine with a rotating belt&#8230; and stare at a wall.&#8221;  Maybe if Minnesota weren&#8217;t a frozen wasteland, and running outside were more of an option, it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad.  After failing to train for a 5k several times, I decided there had to be an alternative way.<figure id="attachment_979" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

**Step 1. Eat Better**

Food is delicious.  No, seriously.  Have you ever eaten and [Fogo de Chao][2]?  If yes, I don&#8217;t need to explain the word &#8220;meatgasm&#8221; to you.  And the [Melting Pot][3]?  Skip the fondue forks and just give me a ladle.  I don&#8217;t even care if it results in third degree burns.

The quality of food I normally eat is not exactly &#8220;healthy&#8221;.  A double stacked bacon cheeseburger with a side order of sweet potato fries is mostly on par with a normal dinner.  Oh, and don&#8217;t forget an appetizer!  The starting point for being more health conscious has been making small adjustments to what I eat.  Side of fries?  Replaced with a side salad.  Large soda usually refilled twice?  Water.  Burger?  Well, that stayed.  Any time I&#8217;ve tried to go 100% with my meal options, they stop being so tasty and I give up.

**Step 2. Eat Less**

I eat fast.  Stupidly fast.  On one of the first dates with my now-girlfriend, I finished my entrée before she finished cutting her chicken breast.  Maybe that speaks more about her cutting capabilities, but I digress.

My eyes are almost always larger than my stomach, but I also hate leaving an empty plate.  Reminding myself that my stomach doesn&#8217;t need as much food as I normally order before opening up a menu has helped me to keep my portions smaller.  Also to help curb my appetite I&#8217;ve also been drinking a lot more water, all throughout the day.

**Step 3. Optional Workouts**

Working out is great for you, but like I said, I hate it.  For the past few weeks I&#8217;ve tried to run on the treadmills in our apartment facility.  In the past I&#8217;ve treated working out as a work/reward system: workout, eat something not necessarily good for me but delicious.  The problem with that has been it being a net-0 system.

Losing weight, for the most part, can be simplified down to an easy equation: burn more calories than you consume and you lose weight.  Working out burns off more calories, and the reward is now the endorphins that flood my system afterwards.<figure id="attachment_980" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

**Step 4. Sweet Sugary Drugs**

One of the biggest things that has helped has been a mentality change.  I&#8217;ve mentally classified sweets and sugary snacks as &#8220;drugs&#8221;.  &#8220;Drugs&#8221; encompasses anything that tastes delicious, makes me happy, but isn&#8217;t good for my body.  Beer & ice cream are now on the same plane.

It&#8217;s easier to say &#8220;no&#8221; to something when you can look at it and think, &#8220;Yea, that&#8217;s delicious, but it&#8217;s not good for me.&#8221;  Do I still eat junk food?  Of course I do!  Just not as frequent and in as large of quantities as before.

**Step 5. Moderate**

The important thing has been to moderate everything.  If there is an option to take stairs over an elevator, I&#8217;ll do it.  One beer instead of two.  Salad instead of fries.  But as my father once told me, &#8220;Everything requires moderation, even moderation itself.&#8221;  My will still isn&#8217;t strong enough to always resist snacks, or being lazy for a day.  Instead of breaking, I allow myself to bend.  A day off from the strict regime is totally fine, and I can get back into the swing of things the next day.  I&#8217;ve found this is exceptionally helpful in keeping up with things long term.

&nbsp;

With these things in mind, I&#8217;ve lost 20lbs.  While I don&#8217;t consider this journey &#8220;done&#8221;, I&#8217;ve been exceptionally happy with the progress.  Hopefully be the time summer rolls around I&#8217;ll be ready to sport a new swimsuit!
