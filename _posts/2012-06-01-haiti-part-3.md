Do the Haiti posts ever end?!?!  I certainly hope not.  If all goes well, by the time I run out of content to post I&#8217;ll be back there doing some more work.

On our third day in Haiti we were fortunate enough to be given a tour of [Louverture Cleary][1], a non-profit Haitian boarding school that works to educate young people in the community.  Put short, I think they are doing some great work out there, but their headmaster/president/leader is a pompous ass.  That said, the volunteers are great people who truly care about the students there.  All of the students are friendly and respectful.  They have beautiful gardens with magnificent flowers.

The students themselves take part in maintaining the gardens, though they do have a gardener who helps as well.

Since Louverture Cleary is a boarding school, all of the students live there from Monday to Friday, and then go home on the weekend to see their family.  Having so many kids around requires a large kitchen staff with HUGE pots.  We walked through the kitchen and saw women hard at work with smiles on their faces.<figure id="attachment_62" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Since buildings cannot rely on electricity from the city, Louverture Cleary has installed solar panels on their roof, and maintains a bank of battery backups, in order to provide power all day long to their students.  They also have two large generators they can run in case the solar panels do not get enough sun throughout the day.

On the way back from LC to our temporary home with the Missionaries of Charity, I was able to snap a picture of one of the local &#8220;taxis&#8221;.  They are called &#8220;tap taps&#8221;, I can only assume because you bang on the side when you want to get off, and they pull over to let you depart.  Most of them are old pickup trucks that have a bed cover installed with extensions, so people can sit in the back.

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-64" title="TapTap" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0252-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][7]

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65" title="Dirty TapTap" src="http://blog.pintozzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0259-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" />][8]

The second picture is pretty out of focus, it seems my camera decided to focus on the dirt on the window, rather than the tap tap itself, but you can see people huddled into the back.  I&#8217;m not sure exactly how they pay, I think it&#8217;s just on the honor system.

It was great to see a children of Haiti being given a wonderful education, including three new languages!  (Spanish, French, and English were all taught there)  I hope LC and schools like it can continue their programs, and gain support from people/groups here in the States.
