This weekend I&#8217;m in Chicago visiting Brad for his birthday, and since I don&#8217;t do as much programming on the road anymore, I simply brought my iPad instead of my Macbook Pro. The main area that the iPad lacks in is multitasking. Yea, you can switch back and forth between apps, but you can&#8217;t watch a movie while simultaneously typing out a blog post. Or can you&#8230;&#8230;?  
I&#8217;ve always been a supporter or jailbreaking. For a power user, there are many tweaks that jailbreaking can provide, which make the iPad experience more, well, powerful. One such tweak is Quasar, which brings a basic window manager to iOS. My experience after installing this has greatly improved, and in a sense I now have true multitasking.

Combined with the Apple Wireless Keyboard I&#8217;m decently happy with this laptop &#8220;replacement&#8221;. While it definitely has it&#8217;s shortcomings, they are small enough that the benefits of the iPad outweigh them. One of the biggest benefits is the battery life, no laptop I&#8217;ve ever owned can compete with the battery life of this thing. Another is it&#8217;s portability, nothing is quite as light and conveniently sized. Goodbye Macbook Pro! Until I pickup a Retina Display MBP atelast&#8230;
