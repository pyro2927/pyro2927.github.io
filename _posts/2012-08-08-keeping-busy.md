How time has flown by.  It&#8217;s already Wednesday and I barely even noticed.  Monday was the first full day back at the original GoKart Labs.  Breakfast snacks were there before I even got it, and made it a wonderful start to a Monday.<figure id="attachment_519" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

On my lunch break I finally had time to take in my MSO and sales tax reimbursement check from Illinois to the Minnesota DMV and register my Camaro.  I had previously visited the DMV and hadn&#8217;t had all of the paperwork necessary.  The lady who helped me was nice, and gave me a &#8220;skip the line pass&#8221;, so when I went in the second time I only had to wait about five minutes before I was helped.<figure id="attachment_521" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Pretty soon I was out the door with my temporary sticker, and to celebrate Erin and I took a trip up to White Bear Lake for ice cream.<figure id="attachment_518" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

More recently I enrolled in [CodeSchool][4], not only to stay fresh with programming concepts, but also to branch out into new programming languages and frameworks.  While it&#8217;s a little pricey ($20 a month), it already seems to be proving its worth.  For lunch today I walked with Tate (coworker) to a Greek joint down the street that had absolutely amazing gyros.  As a bonus the guy behind the counter gave us both free pieces of chocolate cake!<figure id="attachment_520" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

While things have been busy, they&#8217;ve also been a total blast.  I&#8217;m having a ton of fun in this city, I&#8217;m really enjoying my new job, my coworkers are fantastic, and I&#8217;m happy to have a place with Erin.
