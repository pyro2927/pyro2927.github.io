So the "electrical problem" with my Hawk seems to have simply been a weak battery. I replaced it with a new on and the whole thing seems to be holding a charge nicely with no drainage when the bike is shut off. I will be conducting more voltage and current tests this evening to double check, but all seems great so far.
