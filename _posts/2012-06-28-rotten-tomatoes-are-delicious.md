As I have only been watching TV on Netflix and Amazon Prime, I haven&#8217;t seen many commercials recently, if any at all.  I&#8217;ve resorted to using Rotten Tomatoes as the place to go for what movies are good.  The past several I&#8217;ve watched have been absolutely AMAZING.  The Grey, Goon, Chronicle, and Jeff Who Lives at Home have filled up the past several days.  Some might say it&#8217;s anti-social to sit home most of my weekdays and watch movies, but I enjoy doing so as I get to learning more of this city.

Tomorrow I&#8217;m taking off work to buy a car and go camping.  I will be meeting Erin and some friends at the [Wolf River Campground][1]in Wisconsin.  Prior to that, in the morning, I will be flying into O&#8217;Hare, and then being brought to Joliet to buy my first NEW car.  I&#8217;m quite excited.  You might be asking, &#8220;But Joe, why fly out to a dealership over 300 miles away to buy a car?  Aren&#8217;t there dealerships much closer to you?&#8221;  In fact there are plenty, but none of them have a 2012 Chevrolet Camaro 45th Anniversary Edition in stock.  And that, my friend, is why I&#8217;m flying out to Illinois.  Will the gas millage be better than my truck? If I drove it conservatively, yes, but we all know you don&#8217;t but a Camaro to drive it conservatively.  Realistically I&#8217;ll get worse gas millage, but considering I walk/take the bus to work, I recently have been driving FAR less and only been needing to put gas in my truck about once a month.  I look forward to picking it up, and taking a 4+ hour drive to Wolf River to meet up with my friends.<figure id="attachment_417" style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
