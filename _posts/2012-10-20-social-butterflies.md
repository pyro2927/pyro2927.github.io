This weekend has been a blast, and both Erin and I have been having awesome social adventures. On Friday we hit up the Shout House with Jake and Samantha. There was a short stint where they just belted out a Disney songs.<figure id="attachment_626" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Before going out though, we cooked up some great dinner! Well, at least I did. Erin is usually the house/apartment cook so I thought it would be nice to return the favor. On my work lunch break on Thursday I picked up some goods from the downtown Minneapolis Farmer&#8217;s Market. Fresh corn on the cob, peppers of various colors, and hand picked tomatoes accompanied white rice and chicken.<figure id="attachment_627" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Today (Saturday), Erin and I brought Tucker to visit Chad and his family in Saint Anthony. We all played in the back yard for about two hours, and I was easily the most worn out by the end of it. A quick power nap was a great way to reenergize. Then this evening Sam and Mike stopped by for some burgers and other miscellaneous food things. (Side note, they do [GREAT frontend web development][4].) In preparation I stopped by the local liquor store, Big Top! I find it humorous that it&#8217;s called Big Top, and the logo is literally a circus tent. They do have a fantastic micro-brew section, both local and domestic.<figure id="attachment_629" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

In my preparations I failed to get cheese for the hamburgers. I&#8217;ve never been a fan of having cheeseburgers, so much so that I had a whole shopping list for dinner and didn&#8217;t even write cheese down. A quick jog over to the nearby gas station and I was able to grab some. Along the way I was able to get a quick panoramic photo of our apartment building.<figure id="attachment_631" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It&#8217;s been a great weekend with great people, and I look forward to a lazy Sunday tomorrow.
