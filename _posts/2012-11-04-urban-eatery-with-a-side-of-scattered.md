Erin and I really like to go out and eat, and the Twin Cities have more than plenty of fun places to choose from. It&#8217;s nice to have a list of fun places to go, so I&#8217;ll be tagging posts with fun places to eat as &#8220;TCeats&#8221;.

This weekend we had the opportunity to stop by [Urban Eatery][1]. I wasn&#8217;t expecting much from the name, but was pleasantly surprised by the free valet parking as we arrived. The interior decor was quite fancy, but it still had a sense of fun with chalkboard walls and specials hand written on them. The meal itself was delicious, and most certainly not overpriced. The only thing disappointing was the dessert. I had the hot apple crisp with ice cream, and while it wasn&#8217;t bad, it just wasn&#8217;t I consider worth getting.

Scattered is simply how my brain feels. Over the past 4 days I&#8217;ve been pitched 3 app ideas. I think they all sound cool, but I&#8217;ll definitely need to work on focusing on each idea. Two client projects are coming to an end, so that will definitely free up time. Tonight I go to bed with the giant giraffe pillow pet I bought Erin. He&#8217;s big and fluffy, and hopefully provides a good night sleep.
