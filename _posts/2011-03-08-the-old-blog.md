Sadly, the old blog crashed, so I'm going to try to catch everyone up with this post.

I have a 1988 Honda Hawk GT 650 that I am working on customizing.  So far I've added on a new chain w/sprockets, and have a spare subframe that was updated to fit a Ducati Monster seat by a good friend!  Will post more pictures as a salvage them
