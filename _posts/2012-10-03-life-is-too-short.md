I got a text message this morning from my sister that my Omi (grandmother) is being admitted to the hospital with [a-fib][1].  I hate being a 7 hour drive away at times like these, but also happy to work at a place that would completely understand if I needed to run out the door at a moment&#8217;s notice.

My brain can&#8217;t seem to focus much more right now, so I&#8217;ll be ending this short.  To all who read this, make sure to give your grandparents an extra big hug next time you see them.
