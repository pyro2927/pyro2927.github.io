What is this now, the forth blog I've attempted to start?  Hopefully this one sticks.  All the others seem to have failed due to the fact I would pidgin hole the content.  First there was the tech blog, then the personal blog, then the motorcycle blog.  I've come to realize trying to maintain three separate blogs is silly, and I really should just dump everything into one.  So that's what I'm starting here.  Now.  One day there might be some stuff about Ruby, and cool new gems I've found.  The next day it may be a posting about a new microbrew I discovered.  Or maybe just some pictures I end up taking on a motorcycle trip.  Think of it as a personal journal for me.  A chronicling of my life story, except it's open to anyone who wishes to read.

Oh, about that title.  As a sit here in my parent's basement, I have a lot on my mind.  I'm moving out to Minneapolis in two weeks, yet I haven't fully secured a place to live.  In less than six hours I will be flying to Haiti for eight days, working at an orphanage and taking care of hungry/sick children.  And somewhere in between those two events, I'm supposed to be taking a trip up to Toronto, Ontario to visit my good friend Bob.  Mix in family, friends, paying bills, and it quickly becomes a little overwhelming.  I'm on the cusp of the next chapter in life's journey.  I don't know what will be coming next, but I sure hope it'll be fun.
