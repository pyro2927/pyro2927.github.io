What is this now, the forth blog I&#8217;ve attempted to start?  Hopefully this one sticks.  All the others seem to have failed due to the fact I would pidgin hole the content.  First there was the tech blog, then the personal blog, then the motorcycle blog.  I&#8217;ve come to realize trying to maintain three separate blogs is silly, and I really should just dump everything into one.  So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m starting here.  Now.  One day there might be some stuff about Ruby, and cool new gems I&#8217;ve found.  The next day it may be a posting about a new microbrew I discovered.  Or maybe just some pictures I end up taking on a motorcycle trip.  Think of it as a personal journal for me.  A chronicling of my life story, except it&#8217;s open to anyone who wishes to read.

Oh, about that title.  As a sit here in my parent&#8217;s basement, I have a lot on my mind.  I&#8217;m moving out to Minneapolis in two weeks, yet I haven&#8217;t fully secured a place to live.  In less than six hours I will be flying to Haiti for eight days, working at an orphanage and taking care of hungry/sick children.  And somewhere in between those two events, I&#8217;m supposed to be taking a trip up to Toronto, Ontario to visit my good friend Bob.  Mix in family, friends, paying bills, and it quickly becomes a little overwhelming.  I&#8217;m on the cusp of the next chapter in life&#8217;s journey.  I don&#8217;t know what will be coming next, but I sure hope it&#8217;ll be fun.
