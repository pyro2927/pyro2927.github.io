Not sure where the title came from, those words are just currently ringing through my head.  After finishing my first day at the new job, I came back to my apartment and just relaxed.  A quick trip to Target allowed me to buy a few groceries, and with them make some spaghetti for dinner.  It seemed fitting, as it was always something my mom would make me, and it was comforting to cook something that reminded me of home.  After eating, I had the pleasure of receiving a phone call from Brad Collins.  For an hour and a half we caught up, shared stories, and reminded of one of the hardest parts about leaving Illinois: leaving my best friends behind.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Brad and I met in the Fall of 2003, in a computer programming class held at Marian Catholic Central High School.  That is also where I met Dan Borkowski.  The two of them have been my best friends, and two of the closest people I&#8217;ve had in my life.  We&#8217;ve played video games until the wee hours of the morning more times than I can count.  We supported each other during the dramatic times in school, talked about girls, discussed our plans for our futures, celebrated each other&#8217;s 21st birthdays, and to this day rely on each other for advice and support.

Part of my hope with this move is to find new friends, not to replace any existing ones, but to add to the wealth of happiness and friendship that I already have.  I would consider myself extremely lucky to find new friends who are half as good as Brad and Danny are.

As I sit here pondering all of this, I enjoy the evening sky, and the night breeze by sitting on my balcony.  I&#8217;ve never had a balcony at any of the places I&#8217;ve lived, and it&#8217;s pretty awesome.  I enjoy hearing the sounds of Minneapolis, trucks rolling by in the distance, quiet conversations of people walking below, and the trees shuffling in the wind.

Too all my friends back home, I miss you all and plan on visiting as soon as I can!<figure id="attachment_364" style="width: 584px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
