One month knocked out of 2014 and things are going great!  In trying to be better at backing up my data, I&#8217;ve setup a [DigitalOcean][1] server with my own instance of [ownCloud][2] to backup my data.  I love Dropbox, but my photo library is growing too large and I wanted to find a more long-term solution.   I also upgraded this blog to the newest version of WordPress!

I haven&#8217;t been writing here much, as most of my blog posts have been directed at [Software for Good][3].  Hopefully as the rest of my life gets a little more organized I&#8217;ll be able to start posting more!
