&#8220;Word hard, play hard.&#8221;  The words I first heard from my father, and I&#8217;ve never forgotten them.  I&#8217;ve been reminded of them again working my new job at GoKart Labs.  The people I work with are bright, energetic, and personable.  Everyone has been nice enough to introduce themselves, and offer information about what they do in their work position.  They also all have cool interests outside of work, from things like teaching yoga to restoring old motorcycles.  I hope that I can maintain a similar level of awesomeness outside of work moving forward.

In other news, I put up some curtains on the Eastward facing window in my apartment.  They don&#8217;t block out the light completely, but it&#8217;s definitely better than nothing.  I&#8217;m slowly getting more and more comfortable in the apartment, and I&#8217;m definitely happy to be in Uptown while I get used to the city.  Tonight Kevin (the guy I&#8217;m subletting from) took me out with another friend of his, Andrew.  The three of us stopped by Joe&#8217;s Garage to have a few wings, burgers, and beers.

Friday is my cousin Tommy&#8217;s wedding.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to it, as it&#8217;ll be a time to see my whole family, including aunts, uncles, and cousins.  Since I don&#8217;t get to see them all the time, I greatly appreciate the time I have with them.  In the end, nothing is more important than family, and I have one of the best ones out there.
