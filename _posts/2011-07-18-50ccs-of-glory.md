I haven&#8217;t posted in a while, and that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been SUPER busy with work, and I&#8217;ve been having an electrical problem on my Hawk, trying to sort it out. In the mean time, here is a picture of the first &#8220;motorcycle&#8221; I ever rode. A beautiful Honda 50R. Been riding it since I was about 10 and it still runs today <img src="https://www.pintozzi.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
