I haven't posted in a while, and that's because I've been SUPER busy with work, and I've been having an electrical problem on my Hawk, trying to sort it out. In the mean time, here is a picture of the first "motorcycle" I ever rode. A beautiful Honda 50R. Been riding it since I was about 10 and it still runs today :)
