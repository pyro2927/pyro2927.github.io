It seems I should have kept my mouth shut last night. Problems are back, and the Hawk is plagued with backfiring issues. The rectifier is also running extremely hot. Early assumption is that the rectifier is not getting enough air flow, therefor not cooling and causing a voltage drop, which keeps the spark plugs from firing properly. Some adjustments will be made on the wiring/layout of the rectifier and I'm going to see if that helps anything this afternoon.
