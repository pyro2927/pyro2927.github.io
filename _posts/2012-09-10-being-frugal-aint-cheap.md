Something I&#8217;ve been practicing more and more is how to spend money wisely, and in doing so I&#8217;ve learned the difference between being frugal and being cheap. I find it extremely important to get the best bang for your buck, and recently almost all of my success has come from leveraging something that so many people use on a day to day basis: the internet.

A big part of my realization of this came today when a good friend of mine, Dan, sent me a link for a discount on [Borderlands 2][1]. I&#8217;ve been wanting to purchase the game for a while, but have been holding off while in the midst of moving to my new apartment in Saint Paul. [Greenman Gaming][2] has the game for 20% off, and you receive an additional 25% off with the coupon code `GMG25-1BW0K-K1A3G`. Combining those two takes a $60 game and brings it down to $36.<figure id="attachment_547" style="width: 618px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[RetailMeNot][4] has been completely invaluable, and is an awesome service that remains completely 100% free. When Erin and I recently had to stay at a hotel, we used [Hotels.com][5] to find the cheapest (but still cleanest!) hotel in the area. We found one for $80/night, and a quick search on RetailMeNot turned up a $20 rebate code, bringing our cost to less than $75/night.

It helps a lot to look around when looking to pay for something. Anything. A big money drain for many people is their cell phone bill each month. I have a minimal plan with AT&T and it costs me roughly $90/month. I&#8217;ve been looking into alternatives, and there are many cheaper alternatives. The deceiving factor is that you do not get the subsidized pricing on phones themselves, so an iPhone 4S will cost you $650. Yes, it seems like a lot, but keep in mind that you only get the $200 pricing on an iPhone when you lock in a two year contract. A $200 phone and the 24 months of AT&T&#8217;s service ends up costing $2360. Virgin Mobile&#8217;s [comparable plan][6] only costs $35/month. While the phone is pricey up front, over the span of two years you only spend $1490, saving $870.

There are plenty of other ways to save money, as long as you research and invest a little bit of time. It becomes trickier when you can only save small amounts over time, and purchases like gas always seem to be a last-minute thing, at least for me. [GasBuddy][7] quickly helps you find the cheapest gas prices in your area. I&#8217;ve seen price differences of $0.30, and if you fill up a 20 gallon tank 4 times a month, you&#8217;re saving $24 a month. It may not seem like a ton, but after a year you save $288.<figure id="attachment_548" style="width: 492px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

My rule of thumb when making a purchase online has always been to Google &#8220;<;WEBSITE_NAME>; coupon/discount codes&#8221;. Worst case scenario you lose 30 seconds of your day.
