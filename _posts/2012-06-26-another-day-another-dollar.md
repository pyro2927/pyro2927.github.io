With a title like that, you would think that today has simply been another day in the life of Joe Pintozzi, when in reality it has been anything but.  I found out earlier today that my grandfather (affectionately called &#8220;Papa&#8221;) is in the hospital.  He was having chest pains, and from what I&#8217;ve been told is in urgent care.  While everything seems to be stable for now, I continue to pray for him to get well.  I ask any of those who believe in a deity of some sort to pray for him, and if you&#8217;re the kind who doesn&#8217;t believe in any higher power, just cross your fingers that the doctors taking care of him paid attention in med school.

Through it all though, I&#8217;m reminded of something my girlfriend said to me, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay to be happy about good things even if you&#8217;re sad about bad things.&#8221;  While it&#8217;s important to feel your emotions for family members and loved ones, it&#8217;s also important to keep on keepin&#8217; on.  I&#8217;m baking some stuffed pasta shells in the over, and watching [The Grey][1].  It seems good so far, and I never question anything made by Liam Neeson.

Being fully independent is bitter sweet.  Everything seems to be tied to so much paperwork.  Nothing is easy, but in the same hand it&#8217;s all extremely rewarding.  The city is still new to me, so everything is exciting and exhilarating.  I look forward to Erin moving up here for her job, as it&#8217;ll be quite nice for us to be close again.
